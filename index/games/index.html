          The first game I ever made! I wrote this when I first began learning
          Javascript, to be specific I wrote the logic during that time. The
          game was only playable through the terminal, now its fairly portable
          and can be integrated into anything.

          Currently only playable on a pc, I haven't tried figuring out how to
          scale down the game lol. I participated in the Opera GX + GameMaker
          game jam and created this monstrosity. The game jam was alien themed,
          however I never got that far. Before taking part in this game jam I
          have never programmed an actual game nor have been in a game jam. I
          learned how to program in GameMaker Language (basically Javascript)
          during the event.
