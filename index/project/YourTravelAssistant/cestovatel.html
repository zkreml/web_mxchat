                        followers. Her blog: HikeBikeTravel is frequently cited as one of the top travel and outdoor
                        adventure blogs in Canada, and consistently receives over 135,000 monthly page views. She
                        shares
                        her enthusiasm for the outdoors as a brand ambassador for Sporting Life, and has worked on
                        campaigns for Travel Alberta, Expedia and Flight Hub. Leigh is the author of Discover

                        Alberta (spring 2018). A true adventurer, Leigh will try anything once, except perhaps
                        bungee
                        jumping.

                        over this planet; you
                        just
                        need to know where to find them. We do. Kilimanjaro, Everest Base Camp, Patagonia, and the Inca
                        Trail are out there, waiting for you to walk all over them. We’re proud of our record of
                        successful
                        ascents (over 92% of our travellers make it to the top of Kili, depending on the route), but
                        it’s
                        our CEOs and local guides that make the journey itself as memorable as the summit. And if you’re
                        not
                        into big climbs, don’t sweat it; we’ve got loads of lower-impact walks and iconic treks you’ll
                        love,
                        too.</p>

                        Leigh McAdam has been making my travel arrangements for about 20 years and there is no one
                        else I would trust to arrange my trips and tours. I've also had great fun on a few of the
                        group trips she has arranged - Peru & Machu Picchu and a 10-day cruise out of Venice and
                        diving. It's always an eclectic group of well traveled, interesting people.
